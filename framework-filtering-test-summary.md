## System Performance Analysis

### âœ… Exclusion System Working Correctly
- **Technical frameworks** excluded for non-technical roles
- **Domain-specific frameworks** filtered appropriately
- **Complex specialized frameworks** excluded for general business roles
- Prevents overwhelming users with irrelevant options

### âœ… Inclusion System Working Correctly
- **Agent-specific frameworks always prioritized first** (100% retention)
- **Relevant cross-industry frameworks** included based on keyword matching
- **Industry context provided** without technical noise
- **Logical framework combinations** maintained

### âœ… Filtering Logic Effectiveness

1. **Prioritization Logic:**
   - Agent frameworks: 100% inclusion rate âœ…
   - Industry frameworks: Filtered based on relevance âœ…
   - Maximum 12 total frameworks to prevent overwhelming âœ…

2. **Keyword Matching:**
   - Requires at least 1 keyword match for inclusion âœ…
   - Sorts by number of matches for prioritization âœ…
   - Takes top 4 most relevant industry frameworks âœ…

3. **Exclusion Rules:**
   - 283 technical frameworks defined for exclusion âœ…
   - Role-specific exclusion rules working properly âœ…
   - Prevents irrelevant technical noise âœ…

## Recommendations

### âœ… System is Working Well
The corrected framework filtering system successfully addresses the original problems:

1. **No more technical noise** for non-technical roles
2. **Relevant industry context** maintained
3. **Agent expertise prioritized** appropriately
4. **Logical combinations** provided

### ðŸ”§ Minor Optimization Opportunities
1. Consider expanding keyword coverage for edge cases
2. Review if 4 industry frameworks is optimal (could be 3-5)
3. Monitor user feedback for framework relevance

## Conclusion

**âœ… FILTERING SYSTEM STATUS: WORKING CORRECTLY**

The corrected framework filtering system successfully excludes irrelevant frameworks while maintaining useful industry context. All five problematic combinations now pass their tests, demonstrating that:

- HR specialists won't see technical cybersecurity frameworks
- Teachers won't see complex financial models  
- Sales reps won't see manufacturing process frameworks
- Creators won't see clinical frameworks
- Coaches won't see technical architecture frameworks

The system maintains the right balance between filtering out noise and providing relevant cross-industry insights.
